# Personal Project - Accio Quotes
## A Java game about blasting words that form a Harry Potter quote

### What is it?
This is a game where the objective is to shoot words in a Harry Potter quote and acquire as many
points possible. The top of the page will be a quote, color coded green if the word 
has been shot, red if there's a missed word, or grey at startup. Words will fall from
the top of the page, and the player will be positioned at the middle bottom of the screen.
Unable to move, the player will only be able to aim at the words, but will have a full 180
degree range of shooting motion.

To summarize, here are the following key objects will be on screen:
- player
- "aiming dots"
- bullets
- words
- quote
- button that goes back to the "all quotes" screen
- input for adding quotes

### Who's the target audience and why am I making this?
This game is targeted towards fans of Harry Potter, or those who have knowledge of the series. As a reader 
myself, one of my favourite books is Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, in which the main characters are 
video game makers. Specifically, one of the characters develops a game called "EmilyBlaster", where the 
objective is to shoot Emily Dickinson quotes in the same manner. Inspired by this, I wanted to see if I 
could make my own version of "EmilyBlaster".
